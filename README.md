## Hi there 👋

I'm a 6th-semester Informatics Engineering student at Gunadarma University, passionate about blending design and technology. I love turning ideas into visual and functional things—whether it’s through design or writing code.

Currently diving deeper into the worlds of Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis, and always open to learning something new. I'm detail-oriented, enjoy problem-solving, and work well both independently and in a team setting.
